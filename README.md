# ISHCUTS Frontend Code

Ishcuts is a booking system and solution I made for my friend's home barbing service. It is also my first project where I used my own API, which I wrote in Express and Node.

## Code Files

1. Index.js - The main js file
2. Account.js - The account side file
3. BookingObject.js - A file containing a booking object class (blueprint)
4. ScheduleObject.js - A file containing a booking schedule class (blueprint)

Feel to go through the files or let me know where improvements can be made, as it's my first project like this and is not perfect.
